The course will teach you how to work with different machine learning models with focus on artificial neural networks.
You will learn how to build your own artificial neural network from scratch and how to use Tensorflow and Keras to create
machine learnings models that can create language and understand vision. The course will also focus on how to get your trained model up and working on the web.


## Python fundamentals
The course is taught in Python and it's good to have some familiarity with Python. If Python is new to you, there are Python resources here that can help you get started.
