The course will teach you how to work with different machine learning models with focus on artificial neural networks.
You will learn how to build your own artificial neural network from scratch and how to use Tensorflow and Keras to create
machine learnings models that can create language and understand vision. The course will also focus on how to get your trained model up and working on the web. 

## Python fundamentals
The course is taught in Python and excepts some familiarity with Python. If python is new to you, there are a repository filled with Python Fundamentals that can help you get started

## Python libraries
The following python libraries are used.

## Tensorflow
Main library for handling the back end for machine learning algorithms. 
htt://tensorflow.org

## Keras
API on top of Tensorflow for working with deep neural networks
http://keras.io

## Numpy
