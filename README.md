The course will teach you how to work with different machine learning models with focus on artificial neural networks.
You will learn how to build your own artificial neural network from scratch and how to use Tensorflow and Keras to create
machine learnings models that can create language and understand vision. The course will also focus on how to get your trained model up and working on the web.


## Part 1 Getting started with AI
How to train a deep neural network and get it up and running. 

[Getting started with AI](https://github.com/bcarlyle/Momentum-AI-machine-learning-course/blob/master/lesson1/Getting%20started%20with%20AI.ipynb)

[Hello world](https://github.com/bcarlyle/Momentum-AI-machine-learning-course/blob/master/lesson1/Hello%20world.ipynb)

In the first lesson you will learn how to get started with deep learning using Keras and Tensorflow. You get to train your own deep neural network that works wih brain imaging data. 

## Part 2 Machine Learning on mobile

In the second lesson we work on getting a machine learning model working on a mobile phone.

## Part 3 General adversarial networks and style transfer

## Using neural networks for making art.

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a class of artificial intelligence algorithms used in unsupervised machine learning, implemented by a system of two neural networks contesting with each other in a zero-sum game framework. They were introduced by Ian Goodfellow et al. in 2014,[1] although the idea of adversarial training dates back to Jürgen Schmidhuber in 1992.[2]

## How does a GAN learn?
![title](lesson3/files/ganlearning.png)
A general adverserial network are two neural networks, one generator and one discriminator. The job of the generator is to create stimuli that can fool the discriminator.

![title](lesson3/files/dcgan.jpg)

The DCGAN network takes as input 100 random numbers drawn from a uniform distribution (we refer to these as a code, or latent variables, in red) 
and outputs an image (in this case 64x64x3 images on the right, in green). 
As the code is changed incrementally, the generated images do too — this shows the model 
has learned features to describe how the world looks, 
rather than just memorizing some examples.
The network (in yellow) is made up of standard convolutional neural network components, such as deconvolutional layers (reverse of convolutional layers), fully connected layers, etc.:
